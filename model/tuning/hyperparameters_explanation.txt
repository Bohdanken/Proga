logistic regression

penalty: testing required

dual: only for l2 penalty

C: 1, testing required
    we expect non-regular coefficients

fit_intercept: testing required

intercept_scaling: no
    because only for liblinear solver

class_weight: balanced
    because of class proportion 25/75 and low true-positive rate

random_state: const (1)
    for result reproducability

solver:
    sag, saga - fast on large datasets
    newton-cholesky - n_samples >> n_features, suitable for binary classification,
                    especially if y is imbalanced (all-vs-one classification)
                    but quadratic to n_features memory usage
    liblinear - should be ok
    newton-cg - no, too large dataset; maybe on subset
    lbfgs - probably no, because large n_features and (probably) quite sparce dataset

max_iter: more than 100 have no improvement, 50 is +-ok; more testing required

multi_class: ovr, because y is binary

verbose: testing required
    verbose=0: No output is printed during training.
    verbose=1: The algorithm prints one line of output for each epoch (or iteration) of training.
    verbose=2: The algorithm prints more detailed information for each epoch, such as the loss function value and training accuracy.
    verbose=3: The algorithm prints even more detailed information for each epoch, including the values of each weight and bias parameter.

warm_start: false; maybe true during one TimeSeriesSplit

n_jobs: depending on RAM, hopefuly 2 (only for multi_class='ovr')

l1_ratio: testing required (only for penalty='elasticnet' (only usable in solver='saga'))
